# risk-of-readmission
  Machine learning model to
  identify patients who are likely to have a 30-day readmission to help
  hospitals to improve communication and care coordination to better engage
  patients and caregivers in discharge plans and in turn, reduce avoidable
  readmissio
  •Patients within the high-risk
  category are more likely to be readmitted within 30 days. In absence of any
  prediction model, hospitals are unable to identify and provide better and
  enhanced care to high-risk patients.

   
  TO-BE Scenario
  •Identify the patients who are
  more likely to be readmitted within 30 days and to risk stratify them, so
  that the hospitals can focus on improving the communication and care
  coordination to better engage patients and caregivers in discharge plans and
  in turn, reduce avoidable readmissions.

  
 
 
  
  Problem Statement


  
  
  Reducing early (<30 days)
  hospital readmissions can improving healthcare quality of care and reduce the
  economic burden on patients.  


  Success Criteria
  •A machine learning prediction
  model to be created to identify patients who are likely to have a 30-day
  readmission.

  •Risk stratify the patients
  (High, Medium, Low) to identify patients who are likely to have a 30-day
  readmission.
